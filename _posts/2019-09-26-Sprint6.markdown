**Project #2: Taking Steps**

**Author: Flinn Tiddy**

**Sprint Number: #6**

**Sprint length: 2 Weeks Holidays**

Sprint 6 was over the holidays which mean't it was up to me to decide how much work needed to get done. I decided this was going to be a clean up sprint, picking up tickets / features that were relatively small but 
that also need to be done. I wouldn't have many weeks after holidays to improve Taking Steps so every sprint counted. I'm making sure I keep up communication with Joon and maintaining my code management by creating branches for new features, creating milestones to represent sprints and doing merge requests after every sprint from our testing branch to master.

Last sprint I completed a main ticket of intergrating Leons algorithms to our application. I now need to work on the design of the home page as its extremely lacking. My plan is to section the page into 3 sections. Firstly a update weight section that I already created, secondly a last statistics section that displays all calculated data on the last activity back to the user. Thirdy a life time statistics section that pulls values from firebase to displays the total amount of steps, distance, time and more.

I used re used the time formatter package I previously installed for the activity page to be able to format raw milliseconds format into HH:MM:SS for the home screen. I also rounded all of the calculated statistics using the .ToFixed() method to give it 3 decimal points instead of 20+.

Above you can see the progression I made when designing the home screen of the application. I developed using percentages to ensure flex would work for all differently sized phones as the android market varies extremely. 
I used the align row styling to get the data to display evenly. I believe skills Ive learnt from taking multimedia this semester became a advantage when coming to design Taking Steps as I understand more UI concepts than before.

Above is a screenshot of testing my new user interface on a smaller sized android phone to ensure the layout doesn't break due to less pixels. The UI passed the test.

Currently our firebase system is lacking information for individual activity which makes it impossible to display data on last activity. I'll need to edit my code inside the Walking.JS page and save steps, distance and more per activity.

Above is the old and new firebase schema for individual activities, this allows me to display steps, distance and more onto the home screen of the app giving the user a better idea of their most recent progress.

Another small feature / bug fix was fixing compatibility with smaller sized screens, the keyboard that pops up covers multiple fields making it hard for the user to see what they are typing.

The problem is shown in the first screenshot above where the user cannot see the password field text input. Second screen is the feature add / bug solved by adding a keyboardavoidingview to the layout of the login screen. 
AvoidingView simply replaces the standard view and uses padding to push everything up.

Screenshots above is proof all of using version control throughout my development of all three tickets and using separate branches. I created a merge request and assigned it to Grayson to approve at the end of the sprint and detailed the new features that have been added. Adding these details is a good way for Grayson to keep up to speed with my progress and Taking Steps progress in my opinion. Joon didn't merge any own his own work or branches into sprint 6's request.

**Reflections:**

Overall it was a successful sprint as I completed three features during my holidays/break, Once class starts back I will need to focus on documenting all our the application for the readme file and begin work on the goals page aswell. Lifetime statistics will also need some development as currently its only displaying dummy data. Firebase will need to be updated with new fields to hold this data for each user. Talking daily with Joon about the project keeps me on track with our progression and the scrums on Mondays and Thursday are always a good way to hear how the other groups are doing.

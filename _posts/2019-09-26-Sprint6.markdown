**Project #2: Taking Steps**

**Author: Flinn Tiddy**

**Sprint Number: #6**

**Sprint length: 2 Weeks**

Sprint 6 was over the holidays which mean't it was up to me to decide how much work needed to get done. I decided this was going to be a clean up sprint, picking up tickets / features that were releatively small but 
that also need to be done. I wouldn't have many weeks after holidays to improve Taking Steps so every sprint counted. I'm making sure I keep up communication with Joon and maintaining my code management by creating branches for new feautres, creating milestones to repersent sprints and doing merge requests after every sprint from our testing branch to master.

Last sprint I completed a main ticket of intergrating Leons alogrithms to our application. I now need to work on the design of the home page as its extermely lacking. My plan is to section the page into 3 sections. Firstly a update weight section that I already created, secondly a last statistics section that displays all caluclated data on the last activity back to the user. Thirdy a life time statistics section that pulls values from firebase to displays the total amount of steps, distance, time and more.

I used re used the time formatter package I previously installed for the activity page to be able to format raw milliseconds format into HH:MM:SS for the home screen. I also rounded all of the calculated statistics using the .ToFixed() method to give it 3 decimal points instead of 20+.

Above you can see the progression I made when designing the home screen of the application. I developed using precentages to ensure flex would work for all differently sized phones as the android market varies extremely. 
I used the align row styling to get the data to display evenly. I believe skills Ive learnt from taking multimedia this semester became a advantage when coming to design Taking Steps as I understand more UI concepts than before.

Above is a screenshot of testing my new user interface on a smaller sized android phone to ensure the layout doesn't break due to less pixels. The UI passed the test.

Currently our firebase system is lacking information for indiviudal activity which makes it impossbile to display data on last activity. I'll need to edit my code inside the Walking.JS page and save steps, distance and more per activity.

Above is the old and new firebase schema for individual activities, this allows me to display steps, distance and more onto the home screen of the app giving the user a better idea of their most recent progress.

**Project #2: Taking Steps**

**Author: Flinn Tiddy**

**Sprint Number: #6**

**Sprint length: 2 Weeks**

Sprint 6 was over the holidays which mean't it was up to me to decide how much work needed to get done. I decided this was going to be a clean up sprint, picking up tickets / features that were releatively small but 
that also need to be done. I wouldn't have many weeks after holidays to improve Taking Steps so every sprint counted. I'm making sure I keep up communication with Joon and maintaining my code management by creating branches for new feautres, creating milestones to repersent sprints and doing merge requests after every sprint from our testing branch to master.

Last sprint I completed a main ticket of intergrating Leons alogrithms to our application. I now need to work on the design of the home page as its extermely lacking. My plan is to section the page into 3 sections. Firstly a update weight section that I already created, secondly a last statistics section that displays all caluclated data on the last activity back to the user. Thirdy a life time statistics section that pulls values from firebase to displays the total amount of steps, distance, time and more.
